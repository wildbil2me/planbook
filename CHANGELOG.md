# Changelog

Notable changes to Planbook, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions, once they exist, follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Nothing has been released.** Everything lands under `## [Unreleased]` until the 1.0.0 call,
which is made against the criteria in `plans/ROADMAP.md` → "What 1.0.0 means" rather than on how
finished the app feels.

An entry goes in as the work lands, per the maintenance protocol — a changelog written at the end
records what someone remembered.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Repo skeleton and docs spine** (WO-1.1). `git init` with integration branch `main` and the
  first phase branch `phase/1-shell-store-roster` cut from the initial commit. The flat,
  buildless file layout: `index.html`, `sw.js`, and `manifest.webmanifest` at the root, plus
  `src/` and `tools/` beside the existing `design/`, `docs/`, and `plans/`. `TESTING.md`, keyed
  to the roadmap's eight phases with an environment header naming desktop and iPad Safari and a
  slot for the iPadOS version. This changelog. A `.gitignore` covering OS cruft and local
  scratch and nothing from a build, because there is no build — and deliberately *not* ignoring
  `package.json` or `node_modules/`, so that one appearing shows up in `git status` instead of
  being hidden.

  `index.html`, `sw.js`, and `manifest.webmanifest` are placeholders that say so in their own
  first lines: WO-1.2 builds the app shell, WO-1.3 the installable offline app. `src/README.md`
  and `tools/README.md` document what belongs in each directory and set the conventions the rest
  of the repo copies — ES modules with relative paths in `src/`, bare-Node `.mjs` scripts in
  `tools/`, no `package.json` in either.

  No app code and no styling ship with this entry. It is the container.
