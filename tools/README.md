# `tools/` — scripts, run by hand

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `verify-shell.mjs` | Drives the real app in headless Edge/Chrome and **measures** what a stylesheet review can only assert. `node tools/verify-shell.mjs` |

The demo build lands in Phase 8 (WO-8.2), modelled on Roll Call!'s `tools/build-demo.mjs`.

## The rule

**Anything scripted is a `.mjs` file here, run under bare Node, with zero dependencies.**

```
node tools/build-demo.mjs
```

That is the whole invocation. There is no `npm run`, because there is no `package.json` — and
there is not going to be one, not even "just for scripts." A `package.json` is how a bundler
arrives six weeks later; it has been proposed and rejected before (see `CLAUDE.md`, and
`plans/b-hygiene.md` in Roll Call!).

- **`.mjs`, not `.js`.** Without a `package.json` declaring `"type": "module"`, Node reads `.js`
  as CommonJS. The extension is what makes `import` work here — it isn't a style preference.
- **Node's standard library only.** `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:url`. If a script needs a
  dependency, the script is doing too much.
- **No script may be required to run the app.** Everything in `tools/` builds something
  optional — a demo, a report, a fixture. `index.html` and `src/` are served as they sit on
  disk, and a teacher's laptop never runs Node.
- **Exit non-zero on failure and say what failed.** These get run once every few months by
  someone who has forgotten how they work.

## `verify-shell.mjs` — and why it is not a test framework

It is one `.mjs` under `tools/`, zero dependencies, run by hand. `CLAUDE.md` and Roll Call!'s
`plans/b-hygiene.md` rule out linters and test frameworks; Roll Call!'s
`design/execution-guide.md` §7 already says to verify by driving the built demo in headless
Edge over CDP. This is that, written down. **`TESTING.md` is still the gate** — nothing here
closes a 👤 item, because no emulator has a thumb or a safe-area inset.

It exists because WO-1.2 shipped `.search-box { min-height: 44px }` around a **19px input**.
The wrapper measured 44px, the input did not, and tapping above the text did nothing. A
stylesheet review calls that line compliant. Measuring it does not.

**One check is expected to fail until WO-1.3 lands:** the `viewport-fit=cover` precondition.
Eight rules declare `env(safe-area-inset-*)` and iOS resolves every one of them to `0` without
that meta value, so the padding is inert. WO-1.3 owns the fix; the run goes green when it does.

### Driving a browser over CDP — four traps, all of which first look like app defects

Every one of these was hit and diagnosed twice, by two different agents, before it was written
down here. That is the entire reason this section exists.

1. **A modern `CSSStyleRule` has its own empty-but-truthy `.cssRules`** (CSS nesting). So the
   obvious rule walk — `if (r.cssRules) { walk(r.cssRules); continue; }` — treats every
   ordinary style rule as a container, recurses into nothing, and skips it. A 123-rule
   stylesheet reports 3, every selector search returns empty, and **nothing throws**. It reads
   as a clean pass. Process the rule, *then* recurse into children. `window.__eachRule` in
   `verify-shell.mjs` is the fixed version; use it rather than writing a second walker.
2. **Headless Chromium with no visible frame never advances a transition or a keyframe.**
   `getComputedStyle` and `getBoundingClientRect` return start-of-animation values, so
   `.modal-close` measures 42.24px — which is 44 × 0.96, the `srIn` keyframe's opening scale —
   and reads exactly like a failed touch target. Inject
   `*,*::before,*::after{transition:none!important;animation:none!important}` before measuring,
   and again after every reload.
3. **`Emulation.setEmulatedMedia`'s `features` list does not reach `pointer`.** It needs
   `setTouchEmulationEnabled` plus `mobile: true` device metrics. Get it wrong and you measure
   the desktop pass and report green — so **assert `matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches`
   before trusting any measurement below it**.
4. **A fixed `--remote-debugging-port` collides** with a previous run that did not shut down
   cleanly, and the failure reads as "the app broke." Pass `--remote-debugging-port=0` and read
   the chosen port from `<user-data-dir>/DevToolsActivePort` (line 1 is the port, line 2 is the
   websocket path).

### Two rules that follow from those

- **Guard every sweep against a vacuous pass.** Assert the walker saw a plausible number of
  rules, that the measurement found a plausible number of controls, that the emulated pointer
  really is coarse. An empty result set and a clean result set are the same value, and three of
  the four traps above produce an empty one silently.
- **A skip is announced, never silent.** When a fixture is missing — the WO-1.2 component shelf
  goes away at WO-1.10, and `window.planbook` with it — the check prints `SKIP` with a reason
  and is counted separately. A suite of 28 checks that quietly becomes a suite of 4 still
  prints green.
