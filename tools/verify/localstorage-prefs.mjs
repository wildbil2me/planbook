/* localstorage-prefs.mjs — planbook_ keys hold UI preferences only
 *
 * WO-1.26 moved these lines out of tools/verify-shell.mjs. They are copied verbatim —
 * same text, same indentation, no re-wrapping — so that the split is a move and nothing else,
 * and so that a body written at the top level of a 32,000-line script still reads the way its
 * author left it. Nothing here launches a browser, a server or a document of its own: the entry
 * file owns all three and hands them over on `h`. `tools/README.md` § "Driving a browser over
 * CDP" says where a new check goes.
